            <p>He ruled in a time of a debilitating plague, buried eight of his children, lost his brother in battle,
                spent a decade at war, betrayed by his most trusted general, and lost his wife in the process. Yet his
                character never wavered. He was acutely aware of his own weaknesses and shortcomings, and was committed
                to becoming a better person throughout his life.</p>

            <p>" The most essential thing in life is to realize there are things we can control, and things we cannot.
                The only things in our control are our own thoughts, opinions, and choices. Everything else — our fate,
                possessions, reputation, other people’s behavior, and environmental events — are out of our control. We
                have no power over them. But crucially, it’s our choice how we think about them. "</p>
